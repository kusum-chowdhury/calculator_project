# calculator_project

The project I'm going to do is to build a calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript.


## motivation

The calculator allow us to do math operations easily. Most calculators help us add, substract, multiply, and divide. some also helps with square rootes and more complex calculations but I'm going to keep it simple as I'm starting out with Javascript.

## build with 
* Html 
* Css
* Javascript
